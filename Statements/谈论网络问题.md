## there are user reports that it's extremely slow to transfer data to servers.
## we'd like to check the network conditions to see if there is any congestions, or packet loss etc

## that web page takes more than 2 min to load, I guess it's the network again.
## but what's weird is, it works perfectly fine for some of my colleagues.
## Couldn't understand Why it's much better for some users than others on the same network link.

## Just because you have bandwidth does not mean that you will have throughput. 

## we don't really know why it's happening at the moment. we'll need to do a live packet capture to understand what's going on in there.
